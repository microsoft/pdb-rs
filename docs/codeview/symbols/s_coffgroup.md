# `S_COFFGROUP` (0x1137) - COFF Group

```c
struct CoffGroup {
    uint32_t cb;
    uint32_t characteristics;
    uint32_t offset;
    uint16_t segment;
    strz name;
};
```

This symbol describes a COFF group (also called a subsection), which is a
contiguous region within a COFF section.

`S_COFFGROUP` records are present only in the `* Linker *` special module.
These records are generated by the linker to describe how the linker has
organized code and data into contiguous subsections.

## Fields

`cb` is the size in bytes of the COFF group.

`characteristics` contains bit flags that describe the properties of this COFF
group. These flags are the same as the COFF section characteristics defined by
the Windows PE format. See [IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER in the Windows
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_section_header)
for details on the flag values.

`offset` is the section-relative offset where this COFF group begins.

`segment` is the section index that contains this COFF group.

`name` is the name of the COFF group. For example, `.text$mn` is a COFF group
within the `.text` segment.

## Example

COFF groups allow the linker to subdivide a section into multiple contiguous
regions. For example, the `.text` section might be divided into several COFF
groups:

- `.text$di` - Dynamic initializers
- `.text$mn` - Main code
- `.text$x` - Exception handling code
- `.text$zz` - Termination code

Each of these groups would be described by a separate `S_COFFGROUP` symbol in
the `* Linker *` module.

## Notes

This symbol can only appear in the `* Linker *` special module, never in regular
module symbol streams or the global symbol stream.

COFF groups are entirely contained within a single COFF section. They represent
a linker-level organization of code and data, and are useful for understanding
how the linker has laid out the executable.
