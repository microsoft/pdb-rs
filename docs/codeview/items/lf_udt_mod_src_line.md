# `LF_UDT_MOD_SRC_LINE` (0x1607) - UDT Source Line in Module

Specifies the source location for the definition of a user-defined type (UDT).
This record is the same as `LF_MOD_SRC_LINE` except that it adds a
`module_index` field.

```c
struct UdtModSrcLine {
    TypeIndex type;
    NameIndex file_name;
    uint32_t line;
    uint16_t module_index;
};
```

Source code comments in `cvinfo.h` imply that this record is generated by the
linker, not the compiler.

`type` is the type being described.

`file_name` points into the [Names Stream](../../pdb/names_stream.md) and
specifies the file name.

`line` is the 1-based line number of the definition of the UDT.

`module_index` is the module index of a module which defined this type.
