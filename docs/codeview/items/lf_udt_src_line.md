# `LF_UDT_SRC_LINE` (0x1606) - UDT Source Line

Specifies the source location for the definition of a user-defined type (UDT).

```c
struct UdtSrcLine {
    TypeIndex type;
    NameIndex file_name;
    uint32_t line;
};
```

Source code comments in `cvinfo.h` imply that this record is generated by the
compiler, not the linker. There is some suggestion that `LF_UDT_SRC_LINE`
records do not appear in linker PDBs, but instead are found in compiler PDBs,
and that the linker converts `LF_UDT_SRC_LINE` records to `LF_UDT_MOD_SRC_LINE`
during linking.

`type` is the type being described.

`file_name` points into the [Names Stream](../../pdb/names_stream.md) and
specifies the file name.

`line` is the 1-based line number of the definition of the UDT.
