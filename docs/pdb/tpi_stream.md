# TPI Stream: Type Database (Fixed Stream 2)

Each PDB contains a TPI Stream, also called the Type Database. The TPI Stream is
always stored in stream 2. The TPI is one of the central data structures of the
PDB; many other structures refer to it, using `TypeIndex` values.

Symbol records stored in the Global Symbol Stream (GSS) and in module symbol
streams refer to type definitions stored in the TPI Stream using `TypeIndex`
values.

For the set of type records which can be stored in the TPI, see
[Types](../codeview/types/types.md).

# Type Stream Header

The Type Stream consists of a header, followed by a series of variable-length
type records.

The header:

```c
// sizeof = 56
struct TypeStreamHeader {
    uint32_t version;
    uint32_t header_size;

    // Fields for Type Records
    uint32_t type_index_begin;      // TypeIndex of the first record; almost always 0x1000
    uint32_t type_index_end;        // Exclusive upper bound of the TypeIndex of the last type record
    uint32_t type_record_bytes;     // The size, in bytes, of the type record data following the header.

    // Fields for Type Hash Stream
    uint16_t hash_stream_index;         // Stream index of the Type Hash Stream, or 0xffff
    uint16_t hash_aux_stream_index;     // Stream index of the Type Hash Aux Stream, or 0xffff
    uint32_t hash_key_size;
    uint32_t num_hash_buckets;
    int32_t  hash_value_buffer_offset;
    uint32_t hash_value_buffer_length;
    int32_t  index_offset_buffer_offset;
    uint32_t index_offset_buffer_length;
    int32_t  hash_adj_buffer_offset;
    uint32_t hash_adj_buffer_length;
};
```

An example of a Type Stream Header:

```

The `header_size` field specifies the actual size of this header. The Type
Records immediately follow the Type Stream Header, at the offset given by
`header_size`. Readers should use the `header_size` value, rather than assuming
that the header has a fixed (compile-time) size.

> Invariant: The `header_size` field cannot be less than 56.

> Invariant: The `header_size` field must be a multiple of 4. This is required
> so that the type records begin on an aligned boundary.

> Invariant: Although the `hash_value_buffer_length`,
> `index_offset_buffer_length`, and `hash_adj_buffer_length` fields are typed as
> signed integers, these fields should never be negative.
Version

The version field specifies the structure of the Type Stream. These are the
defined values for version, in decimal. The names and values come from the
`/PDB/dbi/tpi.h` header file [MS-PDB].

Name             | Value (decimal) | Description
-----------------|----------|-----------
`impv40`         | 19950410 |
`impv41`         | 19951122 |
`impv50Interim`  | 19960307 |
`impv50`         | 19961031 |
`impv70`         | 19990903 |
`impv80`         | 20040203 | The current version. Uses `uint32_t` for the hash keys, and uses CRC-32 for the hashes.

All decoders should expect `impv80` version. All encoders should generate `impv80`.

# Type Index Range

The `type_index_begin` and `type_index_end` fields specify the range of Type
Index values within the type stream, and implicitly specify the number of type
records in the Type Stream.

The `type_index_begin` value specifies the Type Index of the first type record
stored in the stream. Type Index values that are less than `type_index_begin`
are reserved for primitive types, such as void, unsigned int, etc. The value of
`type_index_begin` must be greater than or equal to 4096 (0x1000), because the
first 4096 values are reserved for encoding primitive types. In fact, all
observed PDBs use a value of 4096 for `type_index_begin`; encoders should always
use a value of 4096, because many decoders may assume a fixed value.

`type_index_begin` is a very important parameter. Interpreting many data
structures within the PDB requires knowing the value of `type_index_begin`.

`TypeIndex` values that are numerically less than `type_index_begin` identify
[primitive types](../codeview/primitive_types.md). Primitive types are those
that have a fixed interpretation, such as `int`, and do not require a type
record to describe them.

> Invariant: `type_index_begin` must be greater than or equal to 4096.

The `type_index_end` field specifies the exclusive upper bound of Type Index
values. Thus, the number of type records is equal to
`type_index_end - type_index_begin`.

> Invariant: `type_index_end` must be greater than or equal to `type_index_begin`.

> Invariant: The number of type records stored in the Type Stream must be equal
> to `type_index_end - type_index_begin`.

# Type Records Substream

After the Type Stream Header, the rest of the data in the Type Stream stores
Type Records. The `type_record_bytes` field specifies the length of the type
records, in bytes. The type records are stored within the Type Stream, starting
at the byte offset given by `header_size`.

> Invariant: type_record_bytes must be a multiple of 2.

> Invariant: All type records begin on a 2-byte aligned boundary, within the stream.

> Invariant: header_size + type_record_bytes must be less than or equal to the size of the Type Stream

In all PDBs observed, `header_size + type_record_bytes` is equal to the size of
the Type Stream. It would be possible to store additional data at the end of the
Type Stream after the Type Records, but this has not been observed in practice.

> Determinism: No extra data should be written to the Type Stream after the Type
> Records. The size of the Type Stream must be equal to header_size +
> type_record_bytes.

Type records are variable-length records. Each record begins with a 4-byte
header, which specifies the length and the "kind" of the record.

```c
struct TypeRecordHeader {
  uint16_t size;
  uint16_t kind;
  // followed by kind - 2 bytes of kind-specific data
};
```

The size field specifies the size in bytes of the record. The size field does
not count the size field itself, but it does count the kind field and the
payload bytes.

> Invariant: The TypeRecordHeader.size field must be a multiple of 2, and must
> be greater than or equal to 2.

Type records are aligned at 2-byte boundaries. Unfortunately, many type records
contain fields that have 4-byte alignment, such as `uint32_t`. Encoders and
decoders must handle misaligned access to those fields, either using unaligned
memory accesses or must copy the entire record to a buffer that has a guaranteed
alignment.

The kind field specifies how to interpret a type record. In the PDB
documentation, this kind field uses the "Leaf Type" enumeration. The details of
these records are outside of the scope of this document. See these references:

* LLVM: CodeView Type Records
* `cvinfo.h` in MS public and internal sources, specifically the `LEAF_ENUM_e` type. (`cvinfo.h` in microsoft-pdb public GitHub repo)

This is an example of a single type record:

```
000000d0 : 46 00 07 15 05 00 00 02 74 00 00 00 02 10 00 00 : F.......t.......
000000e0 : 5f 55 53 45 52 5f 41 43 54 49 56 49 54 59 5f 50 : _USER_ACTIVITY_P
000000f0 : 52 45 53 45 4e 43 45 00 2e 3f 41 57 34 5f 55 53 : RESENCE..?AW4_US
00000100 : 45 52 5f 41 43 54 49 56 49 54 59 5f 50 52 45 53 : ER_ACTIVITY_PRES
00000110 : 45 4e 43 45 40 40 00 f1 ba 00 03 12 02 15 03 00 : ENCE@@..........
00000120 : 01 00 4a 4f 42 5f 4f 42 4a 45 43 54 5f 4e 45 54 : ..JOB_OBJECT_NET
00000130 : 5f 52 41 54 45 5f 43 4f 4e 54 52 4f 4c 5f 45 4e : _RATE_CONTROL_EN
```

It begins with the length (0x0046) and the kind (0x1507). In the CodeView
documentation, 0x1507 identifies an `LF_ENUM` type record. Decoding that record
shows that it points to a field list (another type record) using type index
0x1002, and that its name is `_USER_ACTIVITY_PRESENCE`.

To ensure that records are padded to 2-byte alignment, MS PDB writers often
insert 0xF1 bytes at the end of type records. This is visible at offset 0x117 in
the example above. The 0xF1 byte is included in the record length, so the code
that finds record boundaries does not need to know about the 0xF1 byte. When
decoding records, implementations must ignore these 0xF1 bytes. When encoding
records, implementations should use a value of 0xF1 to pad record payloads to an
alignment boundary of 2.

# Hash Stream

The TPI Stream may have a corresponding TPI Hash Stream. The TPI Hash Stream
contains several forms of lookup tables that point into the TPI Stream, which
enables faster searching.

The TPI Stream Header specifies the stream number of the TPI Hash Stream in the
`hash_stream_index` field of the TPI Stream Header. The reserved value 0xFFFF
means that there is no hash stream. All observed PDBs have a valid hash stream.

The Type Hash Stream contains the following substreams:

* Hash Value Buffer
* Index Offset Buffer
* Hash Adjustment Buffer

The byte offset within the Hash Stream and length of each of these substreams is
specified in the TPI Stream Header, not in the Type Hash Stream itself.

Because the Type Stream Header explicitly specifies the starting offset of each
of the substreams, encoders have a degree of freedom in the order of the
substreams. Observationally, the MSVC linker writes these substreams in the
order given above (Hash Value Buffer, Index Offset Buffer, Hash Adjustment
Buffer), with no gaps between them. Also, if a given substream has a length of
zero (which is common for the Hash Adjustment Buffer), then the MSVC linker will
still write the offset where the substream would have been written, rather than
writing a meaningless value for the offset.

PDB encoders should use the same behavior as the MSVC linker:

> Determinism: Encoders should write the substreams in the order specified
> above, with no gaps between the substreams.

> Determinism: If a substream is zero-length, then encoders should still write
> an offset (into the Type Stream Header) where the substream would logically be
> (i.e. the end of the previous substream).

# Hash Value Substream

The Hash Value Substream is a substream of the Type Hash Stream. It contains
hash values for all type records. It is not clear what the purpose of the Hash
Value Substream is.

The Type Stream Header specifies the stream offset and size of the Hash Value
Substream. The Hash Value Substream is optional; it may be empty (zero-length)
even if the Type Stream contains type records. However, if the Hash Value
Substream is present, then it must contain the same number of entries as the
number of type records in the Type Stream.

> Invariant: If `TypeStreamHeader.hash_value_buffer_length` is non-zero then it
> must be a multiple of `hash_key_size` and its value must be
> `num_type_records * hash_key_size`, where `num_type_records` is
> `type_index_end – type_index_end`.

The number of hash values in the Hash Value Substream is equal to
`hash_value_buffer_length / hash_key_size`. This value should either be zero, or
should be equal to the number of types in the Type Record Stream. Each value
corresponds to a type record, by ordering hash values and type records
sequentially. The hash values are computed using CRC-32 (with an initializer of
zero) over the bytes of the entire type record. This includes the type record's
size field, kind field, and record payload.

# Type Record Hash Function

The Hash Value Substream contains hash values computed for each type record. The
hash function is complex because the function depends on the type record kind.
(See `TPI1::hashPrec` defined in `tpi.cpp` in [MS-PDB].)

* For global UDT definitions, use the `LHashPbCb` function over the `name` field
  of the UDT type. The definition of a "global UDT definition" is moderately
  complicated; see `REC::fIsGlobalDefnUdt` in `tpi.cpp`.
  * The type kind must be one of `LF_ALIAS`, `LF_CLASS`, `LF_STRUCTURE`,
    `LF_UNION`, `LF_ENUM`, or `LF_INTERFACE`.
  * If the type kind is LF_ALIAS, then the record is a global UDT definition.
  * If the type kind is other than LF_ALIAS, then these requirements apply:
* The type record must not be a forward declaration. Forward declarations are
  identified by a bit set in the property field of the type record. All of the
  relevant types have the same property bitmask set the same offset, which makes
  testing this requirement easy.
* The type record must not have the scoped bit set in its property bitmask.
* The type record must not be an "anonymous UDT".
   * The type name must not be `<unnamed-tag>` or `__unnamed`.
   * The type name must not end with `::<unnamed-tag>` or `::__unnamed`.

> TODO: Expand this section and fully specify the behavior of `TPI1::hashPrec`.
> That function also uses CRC-32 for hashing some names.

# Hash Index Substream

The Hash Index Substream is stored in the Type Hash Stream. It consists of an
array of fixed-size records with this definition:

```c
// sizeof = 8
struct HashIndexPair {
  uint32_t type_index;
  uint32_t stream_offset;
};
```

This array of `HashIndexPair` structures is sorted in strictly-increasing order
by `type_index`. Each entry specifies the offset within the Type Records
Substream of the corresponding type record. That is, you will need to add the
header_size field to stream_offset to get the absolute byte offset within the
Type Stream.

Observationally, the Hash Index Substream is usually fairly small. There is no
clear pattern to the increases in the type_index of `stream_offset` fields.
Typical values observed are an increase of 80 to 100 Type Index values, and 8000
to 10000 bytes for stream_offset.

The first entry in the array must have `type_index == type_index_begin`, and
must have `stream_offset == 0`.

> Invariant: The byte size of the Hash Index Substream is a multiple of 8.

> Invariant: The entries in Hash Index Substream are ordered with type_index
> strictly increasing, and stream_offset strictly increasing.

# Example

This is an example of the Hash Index Substream. The Hash Index Substream is
highlighted; it is preceded (in this example) by the Hash Value Substream.
 
The first few entries of the Hash Index Substream decode as:

Type Index  | Stream Offset
------------|--------------
0x0000_1000 | 0x0000_0000
0x0000_101F | 0x0000_4022
0x0000_102F | 0x0000_8450
0x0000_1056 | 0x0000_604C
0x0000_10D0 | 0x0000_81CC
0x0000_10FC | 0x0000_A034
0x0000_1157 | 0x0000_C04C

# Hash Adjustment Substream

The purpose and structure of the Hash Adjustment Substream is not
well-understood. [LLVM] suggests that it is related to Edit-and-Continue.
